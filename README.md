# weekly-scheduler
A simple weekly scheduler for myself as a way to also learn React/React Native

# To Install:
Run `npm install` per usual, ensuring you also have the dev dependencies (check package.json)

Download the app [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) for iOS or Android to be able to run on your Android device easily.

**Note: This app has only been tested on Android as it is a personal tool, I am under no obligation to update it for iPhones, please feel free to make a PR**
